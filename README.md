# SimplePaintingSamples-Crossplatform
Just my programmatic painting playground

## OSX_ObjectiveC/SimplePainting: 
  At least osx 10.12 is required. 

## Notes 

  Don't ask me why i'm doing that. Its just a way to get creative mood when i'm unable to continue with my job, code4fun. 
  Actually, when i began i was thinking to make few samples: objective c for osx, QT, maybe python and/or opengl. But it looks i'm currently inspired by objc.
